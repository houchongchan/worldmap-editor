Small Java application that displays the world maps. User can add pins to specific locations of interest by toggling `Pin` on the right side panel and then clicking on the map to add it. 
A pin will be generated on the clicked area and it's respective label will appear on the ride-side panel. The label and description can be editted at any time. The pins are adjustable via dragging as well.
